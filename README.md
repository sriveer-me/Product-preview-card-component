## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Parcel
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Used Parcel for the first time when working on this project. It looks more like a liabality than an asset for now, although this may mean that I am not good at using it yet. learnt the importance of constants in this project. keeping stuff variable is important, but there has to be a standrad..

I am really proud of this code for the first time in a project -

```css
.product{
    width: 30rem;
    @include for-desktop-up{
        width: 60rem;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I plan on studying parcel more in the future. My speed and competency styling components in realtime is not upto snuff.. I plan on working on estimation of time for my projects. Finally something like tailwind.css might help me achieve the speed and reliability that I want.
